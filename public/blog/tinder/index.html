<hr>
                    <p>The aim of this article is to carefully examine dating app culture, and debate whether this new culture is conducive or destructive to finding true love.
</p>
<p>
If you've spent some time around the block, you'll be familiar with Tinder's notoriousness as "the Sex App."
</p>
<p>
Unlike OkCupid, and JDate, Tinder doesn't ask the user for any personal information.
</p>
<p>
The decision of whether or not to pursue a prospect is solely based on looks.
</p>
<p>
Not that there's anything wrong with that! Within the first year of a long-term relationship, physical appearance will probably make up 80% of your reason for staying in the relationship.
</p>
<p>
There's nothing wrong with making decisions based on physical appearance. The true dangers is when any chance of real intimacy is sacrificed on the alter of meaningless sexual encounters.
</p>
<p>
Tinder is an epidemic for the future of love. Here are 3 reasons why I think that is:
</p>

<hr>
<br>
<h3>The Height of Promiscuity: Then and Now</h3>
<br>
<br>
<img src="../../img/1950.jpg">
<hr>
<p>
"We all want freedom, but we also have a basic human need for intimacy and meaning."
</p>
<p>
If you're familiar with the love culture from 70 years ago, then you'll realize just how far we've "evolved" from the norms of way back then.
</p>
<p>
In the 1940's, it was not abnormal for people to decide to get hitched after 3 weeks of knowing each other. So many people died in WWII, that people simply felt the realities of mortality much more intensely then we do today. Not only that, back then "promiscuity" wasn't as commonplace as it is today.
</p>
<p>
Case in point: In 1954, Marilyn Monroe stood on top of a subway grate in NYC, and the resulting photo was considered "the height of promiscuity." I'd compare this with a modern photo of a Miley Cyrus or Beyoncé outfit, but what's the point?
</p>
<p>
In modern society, the pressure to be a "player" is placed not only on women. Men are also made to feel that having 10 women on a string is a sign of masculinity. It's sad. Especially because only 0.1% of men can actually maintain the juggling act. Of course, about 30% of men just pretend like they're juggling 20 leads a time.
</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>The Pros and Cons of Unlimited Possibility</h3>
<hr>
<p>

  So, we live in a society which has been sexually liberated. That's supposed to be a good thing, right?!
  </p>
  <p>
  Here's where it becomes problematic though: we have become debilitated from making commitments because of the ocean of possibilities currently available to us.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 1993, IBM was on the verge of bankruptcy before Lou Gerstner, a new CEO stepped in and saved the business. He attributed IBM's problems to "a lack of focus." The empire was involved in a wide variety of businesses, and spreading itself thin, as a "Jack of all trades," and "Master of none."
  </p>
  <p>
  So, too, with modern dating culture. When we date 2 or 3 people at a time, it becomes very difficult to say no to that possibility of endless variety, and endless choices.
  </p>
  <p>
  Apps, and the internet have opened up the ability to connect instantaneously with a swipe across your mobile phone. That comes with advantages, but also comes with dangers. We are drowning in a sea of endless possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is dangerous because it decreases our ability to take emotional risks. Any time we are thinking of delving deeper into an existing relationship, we instead choose to take another swim in the sea of endless possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
  If we were wise, we would take a lesson from Andy Samberg and his movie "Hot Rod." Andy is able to choose his targets confidently, and has the courage to take risks, both emotionally, and physically.

<hr>
<br>
<h3>Establishing Trust in a Culture of Games</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  When a man and a woman decide to take a chance on love, they are essentially letting their guard down, and choosing not to be cynical about romance.
</p>
<p>
  Since the beginning of time, there have been barriers to achieving this level of trust. Many women often fear that "the guy only wants her for her body," while men often fear "the girl only wants him for the money." This is of course an out-dated saying, and today these concerns are actually intertwined and reversed.
  </p>
  <p>
  Nonetheless, the Tinder culture has re-enforced this gnawing concern amongst women that the guy is solely pursuing her for her looks.
