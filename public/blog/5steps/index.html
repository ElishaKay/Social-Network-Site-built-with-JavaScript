                <hr>
<p>
                We've created this list of "5 steps to generating new business online." Have a look. 
</p>
                 
<br>
              <h3>  1. Create Awesome Content</h3>
<br>
                 
<p>
                Our platforms for sharing content are vast. We all already have audiences of close acquaintances, and business contacts, just waiting to hear from us. And that's exactly why most people freeze up when it comes to sharing content.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                In my opinion, LinkedIn and Facebook, in particular, should not be used for the "hard-sell." You need to get into the ADD-state-of-mind that most people on these platforms are in, and tailor your message around that. For example, use a picture of a monkey in your heading, and write a title like: "Somebody stole this monkey's banana, and you'll never believe what happened next." Now, that's clickable!
                </p>
                                 
                 
                  <br>
                <h3>2. Hyper-Target Your Audience</h3>
                <br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3rS7I6Xyz8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br>
                <hr>
                     
<p>
                When we think of Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, we usually think of these platforms as consumers! We think about all the fun we'll have on them, and all the useful information we'll find there!
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                But, rarely do we pause to think how these platforms are shamelessly selling all of our information to marketers.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                As a marketer, you can take advantage of these platforms to hyper-target your awesome content to the EXACT group of people you wish to reach.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                For example: "people between the ages of 18-30 searching for '1-piece Pajamas' on Google."
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Or: "people on Facebook that are between the ages of 40-50, have children, and live in Connecticut."
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Or: "people on LinkedIn that are in Managerial positions and are in the 'jewelry design' business."
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                You can understand how, and why, hyper-targeting is dramatically changing the marketing game. 10 years ago, you pretty much had to put up high up-front costs to get your message in Magazine, Radio, or TV, and you never really knew whether the right people heard your message.
                </p>
                   
                 
                  <br>
                <h3>3. Re-Target Your Site's Visitors</h3>
                <br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtHUTCfb-R4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br>
                <hr>
<p>
                Have you ever gone shoe shopping online, only to abandon your shopping cart in the middle? Perhaps you were surprised a week later when those same pair of shoes appeared in banner ads no matter where you went on the internet.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Good morning! The internet is an inter-connected eco-system. There are tons of great services that can re-target people that have visited your site in the past. And the best part of all, is that they will see your banner ads no matter where they go on the internet (this super-power should be used with caution, obviously).
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Nonetheless, imagine paying 5 dollars to send 1,000 ads to people that have very recently expressed interest in your business by visiting your site. If you're not doing this, you are probably losing money.
                </p>
                   
                 
                <br>
                <h3>4. Throw Email into the Mix</h3>
                <br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iuh4hwPXeQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br>
                <hr>             
                <p>
                Email is great because it doesn't cost you any money. Do you remember the days that your parents would walk into the kitchen every day with a huge chunk of mail from the mailbox outside?
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Those days weren't too long ago. Imagine how much those companies were spending monthly to print thousands of flyers and send them via the postal service. Nowadays, every Joe-Shmoe can do this, at a very low-cost, or even for free, with an automated email provider, like Mail-Chimp.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Again, from experience, I can tell you that the hard-sell usually doesn't work with e-mail, especially if that's all your sending them. People prefer helpful content, and things they're interested in. That's probably why they gave you their email in the first place - to be entertained by you.
                </p>
                   
                 
                <br>
                <h3>
                5. Think like Google (i.e. create affiliate partnerships)</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                There is a dramatic change currently happening regarding the way people are making purchasing decisions. When they are searching for something new, they usually start with a Google search!
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                If you run a business and want more traffic to your site, here is step 1: Put yourself into the shoes of a person searching for your product on Google. Type their possible searches into Google. Carefully examine the top sites that appear on that first page of Google's results.
                </p>
                                 
                <p>
                Click through each of those pages. Some of them may be bloggers, or online inventories which advertise similar products. Send them an email, establish a relationship, and see if you can feature your merchandise/service on their site. If you're successful, people can stumble upon you straight from the Google search.
                </p>
                                 
               
                 
                <br>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <br>
               
                <p>
                I truly believe that any business can generate new leads by making a small investment in online advertisements. You need to experiment with several channels, and all the while track which traffic is converting best.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you see you are getting the most new clients from one specific source, then double-down on that one source. Repeat the process, and enjoy your new sources of revenue.
              </p>
